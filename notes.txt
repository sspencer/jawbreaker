Daily Game:
    random seed is *today's date*, e.g. 20240828
    server keeps track of global high score, etc
    index page is served with initial date
    thereafter, everytime api is access, date is served

Random Game:
    Math.random

LocalStore keeps track of both daily and random game so user can
switch back and forth (this means 2 current scores are needed)
